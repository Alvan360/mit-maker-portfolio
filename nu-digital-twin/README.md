## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+

### Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alvan360/NUBostonbuildings.git
cd NUBostonbuildings
npm install
npm start
```

Server starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Uses `--watch` for auto-restart on file changes.

## Static Building Data

68 Northeastern University buildings are hardcoded in `buildings-data.js` with real polygon footprints sourced from OpenStreetMap. Each entry includes `rotation`, `mirrorX`, `mirrorY`, `shiftX`, and `shiftY` transform values used to align the extrusion with the basemap.

### Original buildings (IDs 200–247)

| Building | Height |
|----------|--------|
| Snell Engineering Center | 22 m |
| Curry Student Center | 30 m |
| Snell Library | 20 m |
| Egan Engineering/Science | 28 m |
| Mugar Life Sciences | 28 m |
| ...and 43 more |

### Additional campus buildings (IDs 300–319)

| Building | Height |
|----------|--------|
| Building 300 (tall) | 102 m |
| Reynolds Hall | 18 m |
| Light Hall | 18 m |
| Levine Hall | 18 m |
| Burstein Hall | 3.5 m |
| Fenway Center | 18 m |
| Renaissance Park | 31.5 m |
| Renaissance Parking Garage | 35 m |
| Lightview | 73.5 m |
| Church Park Luxury Apartments | 38.5 m |
| Center for Engineering, Innovation and Sciences | 18 m |
| Watson / Dobbs / Wentworth Hall | 18 m each |
| Symphony Plaza East | 44 m |
| 407 Huntington Avenue | 17.5 m |
| Davenport Commons A/B | 18 m each |
| Northampton Street Residences | 18 m |

Additional buildings can be added via the API.

## Deployment

The project includes a `render.yaml` for one-click deployment on Render.

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render as a **Web Service**
2. Render auto-detects `render.yaml` and configures the build
3. Add custom domain `www.nu-digital-twin.com` in Render dashboard
4. Set DNS: 2 CNAME records (`www` → `nu-digital-twin.onrender.com`), plus an A record for `@` from Render's IP

> **Note:** Render's free tier uses an ephemeral filesystem. The SQLite database resets on each deploy. Static building data from `buildings-data.js` is always available since it's served from the repo.
